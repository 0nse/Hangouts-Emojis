#Hangouts-Emojis
This project aims to allow the usage of the emojis introduced by [Google Hangouts](https://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/) with the cross-plattform instant messenger [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/). The project is a fork of Cal Henderson's [emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data) who processed the images from Trevor Turk's [gemoji](https://github.com/github/gemoji)s. For creating the theme file, Steffen Vogel's [unicode-emoji](https://github.com/stv0g/unicode-emoji/)s theme file has been reused. Changes have been made so that more emojis are supported, some codes have been fixed and new codes have been added. The codes are a mix of the syntax used by the official Google Hangouts clients and codes for regular smilies.

If you do not know how to install a Pidgin smiley theme, please refer to the [official documentation on this topic](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/SmileyThemes).
